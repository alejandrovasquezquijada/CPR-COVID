# CPR-COVID

In this project, we implement Bayesian Structural Time Series (BTST) Models to estimate the short-term (30 days), medium-term (90 and 180 days), and long-term (270 days) causal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country risk premiums (CPR) in several countries of Latin America. We implement a local linear trend model, which is a simplified version of BTST models that does not include control covariates or seasonality components.
